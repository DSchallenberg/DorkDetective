# DorkDetective
**Ready for use Google Dorks at your fingertips**

The Code works with placeholder inside a lists, searches for all Google Dorks inside the json file for which the input placeholders match. Then it returns the Google Dorks which match with filled in place holders, so the dorks can be copied and pasted. Also the Dorks includes German explanations. The explanations are also part of the json file. 

If you add more placeholders to the list in python, you can make this program even more versatile. If you add more placeholders, respective input field will be added automatically added to the GUI and the search algorithm will look for them too.

Code with English comments and variable names will follow soon.

At this stage the code is very minimalistic and the usecases are limited. But it has a huge potential. With some automation, webscraping (e.g. the GHDB Google Hacking Database) and so on, one could create a very versatile Google Dorks Tool to make advanced Google searches available to anyone.

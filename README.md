# DorkDetective
**Ready for use Google Dorks at your fingertips**

This code works with placeholders inside a list. It searches a JSON file for all Google dorks that match the input placeholders. It then returns the matching Google dorks with the placeholders filled in, so the dorks can be copied and pasted. The program also includes German explanations for each Dork, which are stored in the JSON file. The code only returns results where one or any combination of the input placeholders match. It does not display dorks where any of the input placeholders are missing. Despite having under 50 lines of code excluding comments, the Python code is compact yet easy to read.

Adding more placeholders to the list in Python makes this program more versatile. Any new placeholders will automatically add input fields to the GUI, and the search algorithm will include them in its matching.

The code currently uses German comments and variable names, but an English version is coming soon.

At this early stage, the use cases are limited, but the code has huge potential. With some added automation, web scraping (e.g. from the Google Hacking Database), and more, it could become a versatile Google dorks tool. That would make advanced Google searches accessible to anyone.
